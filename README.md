creating a python "Pong" game 

## Step by Step Approach

1. Using Python library `turtle`, I will use it to create a pong game

2. Creating a window screen using by assigning a variable to `turtle.Screen()`

3. I made the background light blue and the paddle navy color and the ball yellow and aligned in the center

4. To make the paddle moving up and down, I created a function call.

##

## Problems I encountered:
1. The paddle function does not work. It has this error message when I set the Y coordinates
` line 46, in pad_mov_up pad_mov_up.sety(y) AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'sety'`
